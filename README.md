# Super Smart AI Calculator

Welcome to the Super Smart AI Calculator project! This is a Python-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations and provide AI-enhanced results for more complex expressions.

## Project Structure


- `app`: Contains the core components of the project.
- `calculator.py`: Defines the basic calculator functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- `ai_model.py`: Implements an AI model to enhance calculator capabilities.
- `main.py`: The main script that interacts with both the calculator and AI model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required libraries for the project.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using the following command:


2. Train or acquire an AI model for the `ai_model.py` file. Replace `'path_to_your_trained_model'` with the actual path to the trained model.

3. Run the `main.py` script:


4. Enter an expression to calculate or type 'exit' to quit the program. The calculator will provide both standard and AI-enhanced results for the expression.

## Enhancements

This project serves as a basic example of a smart calculator. You can further enhance the project in the following ways:

- Implement more advanced calculator functions.
- Improve the AI model's accuracy and expand its capabilities.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator.
- Add support for more complex mathematical expressions.

Feel free to customize and extend the project based on your interests and requirements.
